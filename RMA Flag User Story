To provide all users a method for marking, identifying, and processing certain RMA devices that require further review. 

As an Operations Level User 
- I would like a way to recognize serials that need to be removed from the standard RMA flow.   
- I would like a way to process the above serials seperately from those in the same RMA (I believe this one's already in place) 


As a Support Level User 
- I would like a way to mark serials that will need to removed from the standard RMA flow. 
- I would like a set of flags that will differentiate between the types of actions required for each serial (eg. Engineering Review, Mark Defective for Replacement, etc..) 
- I would like a way to attach short descrptions to the each flag (tooltip popup?) that will clarify the purpose for said flag / identify what kind of additional testing it requires 
- I would like a way to remove flags as needed


As a Tech-Ops (tester?) Level User 
- I would like a way to mark "defective" devices that have been tested
- I would like a set of flags for the results of my testing(s) 
- I would like a way to remove flags as needed
