? How to craft an error message for fails ? 


I'm having problem rendering the data from meetup in conjunction with the one from tastedive. By themselves, they work just fine, and to clarify; the data from TasteDive is getting rendered but not the one from Meetup.... I think it's the way i'm naming the objects and then passing them on their respective renderXXXXResults functions (starting @ line 100). The error I'm getting is a "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '1' of undefined"  @ index.js line 110.     I included the formats of the returned objects in my Gist: https://gist.github.com/flipflop01/c386927c564e70d3be79fd89eb93e473
